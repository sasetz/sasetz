Hi, I’m @sasetz

Here's some current info about me:
I’m interested mostly in Web, Java Android development, some game development and any other stuff
I program mostly for fun, but I plan to learn how to work in a real environment. All my current projects aren't good enough to call them real projects that I can put in my portfolio
but I would really like to change it. If you want to work as a team or partners, I would be happy to have a conversation with you:
