Hi, Iâ€™m @sasetz ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m interested in Web, Java Android development, some game development and any other stuff
- Iâ€™m currently trying to learn C++, 
- Right now I'm trying to improve myself in Android
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I may find interesting, feel free to message me!
I program mostly for fun, but I plan to learn how to work in a real environment. All my current projects aren't good enough to call them real projects that I can put in my portfolio
but I would really like to change it. If you want to work as a team or partners, I would be happy to have a conversation with you:
